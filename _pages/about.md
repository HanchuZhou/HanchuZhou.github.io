I am a third year Ph.D. student in UCD DARE Lab. 

My research focuses on Reinforcement Learning, autonomous driving, and LLM. 

I am interested in the industrial research intern in related fields.

Current research
======

ðŸ”¥World model in autonomous driving
------
World Model (WM) learns a compact latent representation of environment dynamics, which offers great generalization capability. Applying WM in autonomous driving enables vehicle to make prediction on unseen scenarios.

ðŸ”¥World model platform
------
We introduce CarDreamer, the first open-source learning platform designed specifically for WM based autonomous driving. We are working to build a healthy open-source community to foster the research in this domain.

ðŸ”¥LLM in autonomous driving
------
Real-world data is crucial but expensive to train an autonomous agent. LLM, with extensive pre-trained knowledge base, excels in producing various outputs. I am working on how to generate high-quality training data for the autonomous vehicle with LLM.
